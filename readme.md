The recent increase in Corona Virus cases lead to research more about its data. 
I came up with this Dashboard which is purely coded in R as a hobby project and to let the world know the latest statistics about corona virus. 
The data is pulled from the John Hopkins University Research Data which is available on Github, this data is updated everyday by sources which includes WHO ( World Health Organization ). 
It took me almost a day to wrangle up this data to be understandable and readable by my dashboard application. 

This dashoard is created using Plotly, Shiny, BS4jDash, DPLYR, GGMAPS, GGPLOT2, Google API, Flexdashboard packages.
